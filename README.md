# FairerEmail
An experimental redesign of the popular Open Source email client [FairEmail](https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail). A big thank you to [Marcel Bokhorst](https://github.com/M66B) for his work.

## My redesign focuses on 4 big things

* Typography
* Cleaning up visual crowdedness
* Shortening and summarizing app messaging
* Fine-tuning colour

## Read this before installation
* The pro features have been disabled in this redesign
* Don't use this build as a daily driver. Use the original [app](https://email.faircode.eu/)
* The Quick setup wizard has been disabled.
* Only visual modifications made. No other code modified.
