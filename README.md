# FairerEmail
An experimental redesign of the popular Open Source email client [FairEmail](https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail)

## My redesign focuses on 4 big things

* Typography

* Cleaning up visual crowdedness

* Shortening and summarizing messages and subtexts)

* Fine-tuning colour

## Old vs New
### Welcome Screen

* The Quick setup wizard has been disabled.
